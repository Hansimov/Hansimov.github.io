# Hansimov's personal site

THis site is a collection of notes from Hansimov:
- https://hansimov.github.io
- Most notes are related to programming, software, and AI.

The original and deprecated site using TiddlyWiki is still available at:
- https://hansimov.github.io/index_OLD.html
- This wiki records how I grow from a beginner to a better programmer.
- I am so grateful to the TiddlyWiki community.

Gist notes are hosted on:
